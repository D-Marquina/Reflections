When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
 local?
When you don't have access to your project files, e.g. when you are travelling
and have to use another person's computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you may not want to pull changes when you are in the middle of coding.
