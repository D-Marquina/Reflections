When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
 local?
When you don't have access to your project files, e.g. when you are travelling
and have to use another person's computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you may not want to pull changes when you are in the middle of coding.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?
A fork is a copied repository that exists in Github's servers. A clone is a
copied repository that exists in your PC. A fork is useful when you want to give
credit to the original author of a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
It allows you to keep track of the remote repository and compare commits. Also,
you can manually pull by merging.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and
what would be harder?
By e-mails, tht would be way too much harder.
